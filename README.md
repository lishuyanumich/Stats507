> The repository is created to share the code for Stats507 homework projects.

## Description
STATS 507 surveys the software tools that are currently popular among data scientists in academia and
industry. The course begins with an accelerated introduction to programming in Python. Next, we focus
on Pythonâ€™s scientific computing stack: numpy, scipy, pandas, and scikit-learn. We also cover regular
expressions, relational databases, and the UNIX/Linux command line. The final part of the course is an
introduction to deep learning using PyTorch.
