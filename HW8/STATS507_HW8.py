# # Question 0 - Slurm [20 points]
# In this question you will write a Slurm script and use Great Lakes to compute the cross-validated MSE for one of your Random Forest or Gradient Boosted Tree models from problem set 7.
#
# Using the superconductivity data and either your best performing Random Forest or model or your best performing Gradient Boosted Tree model from problem set 7, write a Python script to compute the 10-fold cross validation error for your chosen model in parallel using 5 subprocesses. The Python script should be written to run in batch mode.
#
# If you didnâ€™t previously divide data into test, validation, and 10 training folds based on unique materials (see unique_m.csv), redo the data splitting so that materials (rather than rows) are randomized among training folds and the validation and test sets.
#
# Write an associated Slurm shell script to run your multiple process job using 5-6 cores and run the job using the course allocation. Include this Slurm script in your submission.
