In this question I use Pandas to read, clean, and append several data files from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES. I use the data prepared in this question as the starting point for analyses in one or more future problem sets. For this problem, I use the four cohorts spanning the years 2011-2018. 

(a) Use Python and Pandas to read and append the demographic datasets keeping only columns containing the unique ids (SEQN), age (RIDAGEYR), gender (RIAGENDR), race and ethnicity (RIDRETH3), education (DMDEDUC2), and marital status (DMDMARTL), along with the following variables related to the survey weighting: (RIDSTATR, SDMVPSU, SDMVSTRA, WTMEC2YR, WTINT2YR). Add an additional column identifying to which cohort each case belongs. Rename the columns with literate variable names using all lower case and convert each column to an appropriate type. Finally, save the resulting data frame to a serialized “round-trip” format of your choosing (e.g. pickle, feather, or parquet).

(b) Repeat part a for the oral health and dentition data (OHXDEN_*.XPT) retaining the following variables: SEQN, OHDDESTS, tooth counts (OHXxxTC), and coronal cavities (OHXxxCTC).

(c) In the notebook, report the number of cases there are in the two datasets above.
